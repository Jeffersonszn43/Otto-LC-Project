## Otto LC Robotic Control Platform

##### This is a web application that will allow users to control the two Otto LC Robots that we designed based on the Otto LC robots. The web application was built using the SB Admin Bootstrap template. The web application uses Bluetooth Low Energy to allow the robots to connect to the web application allowing users to have control over the robots. The web application enables users to have direct control of the robots allowing users to control the robots using their keyboard, a dance mode where users can choose from a preset list of dances and the robots will perform that dance, autonomous mode where the robots will do autonomous movements, and an interrupt mode where users are able to make the robots dance while the robots are in direct control or autonomous mode. The goal of this web application is to give users a platform to control the two new Otto LC robots that we designed.

## Project Components:

##### The project was built into two parts:

- Designs for the web application for the control of the two Otto LC robots (Max and Jerry).
- Designs that will be built to showcase the basic capabilities that the Otto LC robot is able to do. This part will be included in the final products that will be used to help students learn more about engineering.

##### The software that will allow users to have control over the two robots is completed for the Otto LC Jerry robot and the software for the Otto LC Max robot is under development. The software development for the basic movements of the Otto LC robots (Max and Jerry) is completed for Jerry and is under development for Max. 

## Hardware Compatibility:

##### The software we created for both parts of the project was designed to work on the Microcontrollers below:
- ESP32 NodeMCU 32s
- Raspberry Pi Pico W (For web application)
- Raspberry Pi Pico H

### Robots:
- Max: Based on the ESP32
- Jerry: Based on the Raspberry Pi Pico Microcontrollers
