## Otto LC Robotic Control Platform

##### This is a web application that will allow users to control the two Otto LC Robots that we designed based on the Otto LC robots. The web application uses Bluetooth connection to allow the robots to connect to the web application allowing users to have control over the robots. The web application enables users to have direct control of the robots allowing users to control the robots using their keyboard, a dance mode where users can choose from a preset list of dances and the robots will perform that dance, autonomous mode where the robots will do autonomous movements, and an interrupt mode where users are able to make the robots dance while the robots are in direct control or autonomous mode. The goal of this web application is to give users a platform to control the two new Otto LC robots that we designed.
